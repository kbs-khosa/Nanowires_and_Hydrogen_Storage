# Nanowires_and_Hydrogen_Storage
# The project report focussed on the use of nanowires for storing hydrogen.
# The report first discussed the techniques used for the synthesis of nanowires. This was followed by the discussion of hydrogen storage process and also how hydrogen is released in general from various materials using different methods like photolysis, biophotolysis etc. 
# Then it was discussed how these methods can be used for adsorption and desorption of hydrogen in carbon nanostructures like nanowires.
# The risks involved in working with the nanostructures were also highlighted in the last sections of the report alongwith some of the other options for hydrogen storage like clathrates etc.
